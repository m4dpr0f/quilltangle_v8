## 🎭 WELCOME TO CRYSWORD SAGA

**"Crystal Swords in mutual shatter, opening new portals to worlds of aloha & in which many worlds fit."**

CrySword SAGA is an immersive RPG experience where players embody **elemental spirits** who have fled destroyed planets, carrying the crystal shards of their homeworlds as intelligent protectors. Through the power of **sound and culture**, these refugee spirits gradually recover their memories and reunite with their celestial heritage.

Players discover over time that their characters are not just survivors of cosmic catastrophe—they are **elemental guardians** whose true identities connect to Indigenous peoples on Earth whose lands have been ravaged by resource extraction. Through gameplay, players explore themes of cultural recovery, environmental stewardship, and the power of music to heal collective trauma.

### **What Makes CrySword SAGA Unique?**

- **Crystal Shards as Living Artifacts**: Each shard contains the knowledge and power of entire civilizations
- **Sound as Magic**: Music, rhythm, and vibration channel elemental forces
- **Progressive Revelation**: Characters start with amnesia and recover their true identities through play
- **Multi-Modal Gameplay**: Tabletop, Minecraft, RTS, and mixed reality modes
- **Collective Worldbuilding**: Players co-create the Quillverse through their actions

### **Mining-Affected Peoples & Elemental Connections**

Throughout the Quillverse campaign, players will encounter various elemental spirits whose Earth-based counterparts have been affected by mining operations. Each crystal shard type resonates with specific communities and their traditional relationships with minerals and the land.

## 🌌 THE QUILLVERSE SETTING

The Quillverse is a vast, player-generated multiverse where millions of worlds exist simultaneously. It began when the **Great Cataclysm** destroyed countless planets across the cosmos, scattering refugee populations to new worlds. Survivors carried **crystal shards**—fragments of their shattered homeworlds that contain the collective knowledge, magic, and technology of their civilizations.

### **The Great Migration**

Long ago, a cosmic disaster known as the **Great Cataclysm** shattered planets across the universe. Survivors fled their dying worlds, carrying crystal shards that contained the essence of their civilizations. These shards are not mere rocks—they are **living repositories** of planetary memory, capable of generating armor, weapons, spacecraft, and tools.

Refugees settled on new worlds, but the trauma of loss caused **collective amnesia**. The crystal shards became dormant, their powers inaccessible. Only through the power of **sound and culture** can the shards be awakened and the refugees' true identities recovered.

### **Crystal Shards & Elemental Spirits**

Each crystal shard represents a different planetary civilization and grants unique powers:

- **D12 (Ether/Culture)**: Artistic and cultural shards from worlds of music and creativity
- **D8 (Air/Communication)**: Knowledge shards from worlds of language and wisdom
- **D4 (Fire/Innovation)**: Technology shards from worlds of invention and craft
- **D20 (Water/History)**: Memory shards from worlds of tradition and storytelling
- **D6 (Earth/Stewardship)**: Nature shards from worlds of harmony with the land
- **D10 (Chaos/Transformation)**: Change shards from worlds of revolution and rebirth
- **D100 (Order/Systems)**: Structure shards from worlds of organization and governance
- **D2 (Coin/Exchange)**: Commerce shards from worlds of trade and reciprocity

Players begin with **amnesia**, knowing only that they are refugees with powerful but dormant shards. Through gameplay, they recover their identities as **elemental spirits** connected to Indigenous peoples whose Earth territories have been affected by resource extraction.

### **Bitcoin Mines & Cryptofae Liberation**

The darkest regions of the Quillverse are the **Bitcoin Mines**—vast digital prisons where **Cryptofae** (digital spirits) are enslaved. These mines are not physical; they are **metaphysical constructs** where the energy of destroyed worlds is harvested for profit.

Cryptofae are the digital manifestations of planetary spirits—ethereal beings of pure information who maintain the balance of their homeworlds. When planets are destroyed, their Cryptofae become trapped in these mines, their energies siphoned to power artificial intelligences and maintain the illusion of stability.

Players must navigate these mines to **liberate Cryptofae**, who grant visions of the characters' true identities and awaken dormant crystal shard powers.

### **Saraswati Supercluster**

The ultimate destination of the Quillverse is the **Saraswati Supercluster**—a vast galactic structure where the most ancient and powerful crystal shards originate. This is where the **original civilizations** still exist in their full glory, having never been destroyed.

Journeying to Saraswati requires:
- Awakening all 8 crystal shard types
- Liberating sufficient Cryptofae to form a navigation network
- Mastering the **mutual shatter technique** where crystal swords break against each other to open portals
- Achieving **harmonic resonance** where all shards vibrate in unison

## 🎲 DICE GODZ RPG SYSTEM

CrySword SAGA uses the **Dice Godz** system, where 8 elemental dice represent different aspects of creation and destruction. Each die corresponds to a TEK8 petal and grants unique powers and bonuses.

### **The 8 Dice**

| Die | Element | Aspect | Critical Power |
|-----|---------|--------|----------------|
| **D2** | Coin | Wealth & Exchange | Perfect Balance |
| **D4** | Fire | Innovation & Craft | Creative Breakthrough |

| **D8** | Air | Communication & Wisdom | Perfect Understanding |
| **D10** | Chaos | Transformation & Change | Revolutionary Insight |
| **D12** | Ether | Culture & Sound | Artistic Mastery |
| **D20** | Water | History & Memory | Ancestral Knowledge |
| **D100** | Order | Systems & Structure | Perfect Organization |

### **Resolution Mechanics**

1. **Choose Appropriate Die**: Based on the action's elemental nature
2. **Roll for Success**: Meet or exceed target difficulty
3. **Critical Success**: Rolling maximum value grants special effects
4. **Bonus Multiplier**: Higher rolls grant increased rewards

- They fled a destroyed planet
- They carry a crystal shard of unknown power
- They have basic survival skills

### **Step 2: Choose Starting Shard**
Select one of the 8 crystal shard types as your primary power source. This determines your character's initial abilities and quest direction.

- **Sound-based rituals** (music, chanting, vibration)
- **Cryptofae visions** (liberated digital spirits)

### **Step 5: Guild Affiliation**
