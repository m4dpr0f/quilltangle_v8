# FARMCRAFT / NASEF Engagement Policy
**Version 1.0 | January 2025**

## Overview

This policy governs how Rainbow Roads to Redemption partners engage with NASEF (North America Scholastic Esports Federation) game jams and Minecraft-based educational initiatives, specifically the FARMCRAFT competition.

## Core Principle: Separation of Concerns

Microsoft's Minecraft platform does not permit cryptocurrency or blockchain integration. Therefore, all FARMCRAFT/NASEF deliverables must be **completely independent** from any web3 components.

## What This Means in Practice

### FARMCRAFT Deliverables (Minecraft/NASEF) ✅
- Educational Minecraft builds and maps
- Agricultural simulation gameplay
- In-game achievements and progression
- Team collaboration mechanics
- Standards-aligned curriculum content
- Documentation and lesson plans
- Student portfolios and showcases

### Quillverse/8xM Components (Web3) 🔗
- Token-based incentives (QLX, QLY, QLZ)
- Territory claiming and staking
- Rainbow Roads progression
- Galactic Cluster Nation governance
- Cryptocurrency rewards and trading

### The Firewall

## Engagement Guidelines

### For Educators and Mentors

1. **FARMCRAFT activities stand alone** - Students can participate in NASEF competitions without ever touching the web3 layer
2. **No coercion** - Token rewards are never required or expected as part of educational outcomes
3. **Age-appropriate** - Web3 components require guardian consent for minors
4. **Separate accounts** - Minecraft accounts and wallet addresses are never linked

### For Students

1. **Complete the challenge** - Focus on agricultural simulation, teamwork, and learning
2. **Portfolio your work** - Document builds, strategies, and outcomes
3. **Optional extension** - Adults may choose to recognize achievements through the Quillverse platform separately

### For Partners

1. **Respect the boundary** - Never promote tokens in NASEF/educational contexts
2. **Two distinct programs** - Market them separately to appropriate audiences
3. **Compliance first** - Microsoft/Mojang terms of service take precedence

## Recognized Connection Points

While the systems are separate, there are philosophical alignments:

| FARMCRAFT Concept | Quillverse Parallel |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Agricultural stewardship | QLX Plant Realm (Seed essence) |
| Team collaboration | QLY Business pillar |
| Innovative solutions | QLZ Technology pillar |
| Community building | Galactic Cluster Nations |

These parallels are **conceptual only** and do not create any technical integration.

## Recognition Framework (Post-Competition)

After NASEF competition concludes, adult participants who wish to be recognized on the Quillverse platform may:

1. Submit their FARMCRAFT portfolio to quillverse.org
2. Apply for GCN status with their team as a potential nation
3. Choose whether to engage with token-based incentives

**This is entirely optional and separate from the educational program.**

## Compliance Checklist

Before any FARMCRAFT/NASEF activity:

- [ ] No blockchain/crypto references in materials
- [ ] No wallet connections in Minecraft
- [ ] No token symbols or branding in builds
- [ ] All materials compliant with Microsoft ToS
- [ ] Age-appropriate content only
- [ ] Guardian consent documented for minors
- [ ] Separate marketing channels for web3 content
